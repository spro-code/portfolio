Read the `readme.md` file within this skill, and explore the other available files (tokens, components, guidelines, ui_kits).

If creating visual artifacts (slides, mocks, throwaway prototypes, etc.), copy assets out and create static HTML files for the user to view. If working on production code, you can copy assets and read the rules here to become an expert in designing with this brand.

Key facts:
- **Tokens & global CSS:** link `styles.css` (warm paper + evergreen brand; Newsreader serif / Hanken Grotesk / JetBrains Mono; Lucide icons).
- **Components:** loaded via `_ds_bundle.js`, namespace `window.AbleSpaceDesignSystem_737c4f`. Requires the Lucide UMD script before the bundle.
- **Storytelling modules** (`StoryModule` kinds: challenge / opportunity / insight / solution / metrics / learnings / future, plus `Journey`, `MetricStat`, `PullQuote`, `SectionHeader`) are the brand's signature — use them to structure narrative, case-study, and marketing surfaces.
- **Voice:** warm, direct, expert; sentence case; address the reader as "you"; no emoji. See the CONTENT FUNDAMENTALS section of the readme.

If the user invokes this skill without any other guidance, ask them what they want to build or design, ask some questions, and act as an expert designer who outputs HTML artifacts _or_ production code, depending on the need.
